# mmheroes-rs

A curses-based Rust port of the ["Heroes of Math & Mech"](https://sharpden.github.io/mmheroes/) game.
This port uses the [mmheroes-core-rs](https://github.com/mmheroes/mmheroes-core-rs) library for game logic,
and the [pancurses](https://crates.io/crates/pancurses) crate for rendering it in a terminal of your choice.

This should work on any reasonable platform.

Early development yada yada. Don't expect me to ever finish this though.
